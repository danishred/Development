        <h2>What are Password Managers ?</h2>

        <p><em>Password Managers</em> are softwares which are becoming essential in this day 
        and age where protection of your digital life (Site Passwords, 
        Bank and Credit card details e.t.c) is of the essence.
        </p>
        
        <h2>How do Password Managers work ?</h2>

        <p>They generate <strong>Random</strong> strong Passwords for every site ensuring
        no two sites have the same passwords and provide a secure encrypted vault to store 
        them. This vault is password protected usina a single <strong>Master Password</strong> 
        usually but sometimes secure physical keys can also be utilized.</p>

        <p>As Password Managers, I personally use <strong>Keepass</strong> for offline purposes and <strong>Bitwarden</strong>
        for cloud storing.</p>
